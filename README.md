# reinfConcrete
This repository contain scripts for the design of reinforced concrete elements according to the current_2023 Chilean Code (DS60 and ACI318-08) in kgf,cm, but in some sections there is also use of ACI318-19. Was created for the course Advanced Reinforced Concrete during 2023 that delves into seismic resistant design.
- Frame elements (Columns and Beams)
- Walls {I used T-shaped walls, but the code allow the analysis and design for any wall shape and reinforcement)
- Slabs
- Foundations (isolated footings)

# reinfConcrete
This repository was created for the ```Advanced Reinforced Concrete``` course during 2023-2. This course is focused on seismic-resistant design of reinforced concrete elements according to the 2023 Chilean Code (DS60) and ACI318-08. 

Notes:
- Variables are expressed in kgf and cm.
- Some sections include the use of ACI318-19.
- The repository covers the following elements:
  * Frame elements (square columns and beams)
  * Wall elements (any sectional shape)

I would like to rewrite this repo but using python.

# reinfConcrete
This repository contain scripts the design of reinforced concrete elements according to the current_2023 Chilean Code (DS60 and ACI318-08) in kgf,cm. Was created for the course Advanced Reinforced Concrete during 2023 that delves into seismic resistant design.
- Frame elements (Columns and Beams, for the columns, the script also calculate the length that should be used)
- Walls {I used T-shaped walls, but the code allow the analysis and design for any wall shape and reinforcement)
- Slabs
- Foundations (isolated footings)

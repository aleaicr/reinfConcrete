# reinfConcrete
This repository was created for the ```Advanced Reinforced Concrete``` course during 2023-2. The course focuses on the seismic-resistant design of reinforced concrete elements following the 2023 Chilean Code (DS60) and ACI318-08.

Notes:
- Variables are expressed in kilograms-force (kgf) and centimeters (cm).
- Some sections incorporate the use of ACI318-19.
- The repository covers the design of the following elements:
  * Frame elements (such as square columns and beams)
  * Wall elements (of any sectional shape)

I intend to rewrite and reorganize this repository using Python.

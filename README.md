# reinfConcrete
This repository provides tools for the analysis and design of reinforced concrete structures, initially developed for the Advanced Reinforced Concrete course during the 2023-2 term. The focus is on the seismic-resistant design of reinforced concrete elements in compliance with the 2023 Chilean code and incorporates aspects of ACI 318-19.

Notes:
* **Units**: Variables are expressed in kilograms-force (kgf) and centimeters (cm).
* **Design Elements**:
   * Frame elements, including square columns and beams.
   * Wall elements of any sectional shape.

I intend to rewrite and reorganize this repository using Python.

# reinfConcrete
This repository contains scripts for the design of reinforced concrete elements according to the current 2023 Chilean Code (DS60) and ACI318-08, which are expressed in kgf and cm. Additionally, some sections include the use of ACI318-19. It was created for the Advanced Reinforced Concrete course in 2023, focusing on seismic-resistant design.

The repository covers the following elements:

* Frame elements (Columns and Beams)
* Walls (T-shape, but the script accommodates any desired sectional shape)
